# R-Maps

The map was based on global canopy height grids that were derived from Sentinel-2 & GEDI data for 2020.
The color scheme is a gradient of tree height, with greener being taller (about 40 meters). 
When applying a boundary crop, I didnt include the Athos region as it's considered an autonomous region.
The map was coded in R and took about 3 hours to render on my cpu.
